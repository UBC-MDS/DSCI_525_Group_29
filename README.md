Creators: Arlin Cherian, Artan Zandian, Shi Yan Wang

## Introduction 

This data analysis was performed as part of the DSCI 525, Web and Cloud Computing course at the University of British Columbia's Master of Data Science Program. Our team will use machine learning techniques to predict daily rainfall over NSW, Australia spanning 1889-2014. We will be applying cloud computing resources to analyze this large dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset was gathered by Dr. Tomas Beuzen and was initally obtained from the [SILO database](https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/). More details on dataset can be found [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681?file=26586554).
