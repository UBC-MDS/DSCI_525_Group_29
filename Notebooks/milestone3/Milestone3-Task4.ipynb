    "This notebook is part of Milestone 3, task 3 and is a guided exercise. I have put guidelines and helpful links (as comments) along with this notebook to take you through this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will be using Spark's MLlib. The idea is to tune some hyperparameters of a Random Forest to find an optimum model. Once we know the optimum settings, we'll train a Random Forest in sklearn (task 4)and save it with joblib (task 5) (so that we can use it next week to deploy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here consider MLlib as another python package that you are using, like the scikit-learn. You will be seeing many scikit-learn similar classes and methods available in MLlib for various ML related tasks, you might also notice that some of them are not yet implimented in MLlib. What you write using pyspark package will be using the spark engine to run your code, and hence all the benefits of distributed computing what we discussed in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Here whenever you use spark makes sure that you refer to the right documentation based on the version what you will be using. [Here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/) you can select the version of the spark and go to the correct documentation. In our case we are using spark 3.1.2, and here is the link to spark documetation that you can refer to,\n",

    "\n",
    "You may notice that there are RDD-based API and DataFrame-based (Main Guide) API available in the documentation. You want to focus on DataFrame based API as no one these days use RDD based API. We will discuss the difference in class.\n",
